# Context-Monitoring-App

Health-Dev is a framework that takes high level specification of requirements verified BSN design and automatically generates both the sensor and smart phone code. If I were to use this framework I would use it for the same heart rate and respiratory rate sensing purpose. First, I would have to provide the sensor specification, i.e the type of sensor, I would use a Photoplethysmography(PPG) sensors that would measure from the wrist of the user. In the case of respiratory sensor I would use the Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography(RIP) sensor or a ECG sensor to monitor the breathing patterns. This way we can avoid the need for smartphone camera and accelerometer. I would then give the name of the algorithm to the codebase generator module, i.e Euclidean norm or frequency domain analysis to detect the number of breaths per minute. Now for the heart rate algorithm I would use the peak detection algorithms. Now, for the communication subcomponent - I would use the Bluetooth or ZigBee communication protocol for packet transmission from sensors to mobile device. I would then specify the sampling frequency for each sensor. For example, the PPG sensor can be asked to sample data at 100Hz to accurately detect pulse variations and for the respiratory rate, we can use a sampling rate of 30Hz for smooth detection of breathing cycles. For the network routing, I would provide the routing table for the source and destination ID. The UI aspect is taken care of by the Health-dev framework by default with the inbuilt continuous graph view inputs and buttons. Now coming to the working of the app, it will feedback based on the processed vitals. For example, if the respiratory rate or heart rate goes above or below certain thresholds, the app can send alerts to the user. Like in Project 1, I will store the collected vitals and symptoms in a local database such as RoomDB. By defining the data structure for storing vitals (heart rate, respiratory rate) and symptom ratings together in one table for future use. Then specify the integration with cloud storage for storing data long-term or sharing with medical professionals. I can define how the data will be transmitted securely to a remote server using REST APIs or similar protocols. I would additonally encrypt the stored data to protect the user's sensitive health information. 




I can make use of these stored symptomps ratings over a period of time and then with the help of the bHealthy's context sensing abilities generate behavioral data (eg. step count, daily activity level). By combining symptoms with context information (e.g., physical activity, location, time of day), bHealthy can generate more accurate and timely feedback. For example, If a user logs a high heart rate but is also identified as engaging in physical activity (running), the system can consider this context and notify the user that the elevated heart rate is likely due to exercise rather than a health issue. Conversely, if the user’s heart rate is elevated while resting and they log symptoms like shortness of breath, the app can provide warnings and recommend seeking medical attention. ALso, rather than capturing the vitals and symptoms once, bHealthy can continuously monitor changes in context (e.g., capturing vital signs over time) and refine its understanding of the user’s health state. For instance, by continuously sensing how the user’s heart rate or symptoms change during different activities, the app can create dynamic health profiles. The app can leverage machine learning algorithms to predict and personalize feedback based on previously logged data. Over time, as more data is collected, the system will get better at recognizing patterns and providing medical advice. Now, to breakdown the usage of the 5 componenets of bHealthy. I can use physiological sensor to record vitals and use the assesment application to determine the mental and physical health. Now when it comes to the activty suggestion module, we can make it more interactive by asking the user his fitness goals or othr goals and employ advanced machine learning algorithms to suggest what his vitals need to look like in his journey throught this fitness. I can use some good UI/UX designs that make a user feel good and accomplished, through his wellbeingness journey. The final reports once per month should explain the user what he has accomplished in his set goals and how he can improve further and make future plans according to his comfirt levels.






So, I did understand right from the first class that mobile computing isnt just about Android studio/app development. But after reading the two research appers I have a clear understanding that mobile computing is much more than just app development. It's about context-awarenesss, where systems adapt based on real-time data from sensors. For example, the bHealthy paper highlights how context sensing is crucial to improving health outcomes by leveraging data from various sensors, such as GPS, accelerometers, and even external medical devices. It’s not just the app’s front-end interface that matters, but how mobile devices sense and react to environmental and user-specific contexts that defines modern mobile computing. Another perspective shift is understanding mobile computing as part of a larger distributed system. Mobile devices are not isolated; they interact with cloud servers, IoT devices, other mobile devices, and wearable sensors. In Project 1, we stored the user's symptoms locally in a database (RoomDB), but this could easily be expanded to sync with cloud services for better accessibility and collaboration between healthcare providers. Mobile computing also brings with it challenges around data security and privacy, which are not just issues for app developers but for system architects as well. Mobile devices are constantly gathering sensitive personal data, especially in health applications like Project 1. Data security involves ensuring that data is encrypted, protected, and only accessible to authorized users.  While app development is a crucial aspect of mobile computing, it is only one piece of a larger puzzle that includes system integration, sensor interaction, and intelligent context sensing. By using frameworks like bHealthy and Health-Dev, mobile computing extends to creating complex systems that can analyze, predict, and respond to user needs in real-time.
